# Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy. The purpose of this project is to understand and demonstrate the inner workings of these models without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

## 📌 Features

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Gradient Descent Optimization

## 🧠 Objective

To build core ML algorithms from scratch and gain a deep understanding of their logic, math, and implementation details.
